**Objective**: By the end of this workshop students will have a foundational understanding of SVG syntax and the benefits of using it this way over alternative approaches, such as an `img`. With base CodePen demos in place with instructions together we will get started right away writing and editing basic SVG shapes in the browser. Students will learn first-hand about the SVG workspace and sizing and get to make significant changes to the code of a more complex graphic (grapes!).<br>
